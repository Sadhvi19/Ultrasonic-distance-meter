# Ultrasonic-distance-meter

## Aim 
To measure the distance to a wide range of objects regardless of shape, color or surface texture and 
to measure an approaching or receding object. 
## Objective 
Ultrasonic sensors have been a popular method for distance measurement and object 
detection for many years. Their basic operating principle works by measuring the amount 
of time it takes for their emitted ultrasonic pulse of sound to bounce off an object and 
return, hence the name ultrasonic sensor. An ultrasonic distance meter is a device capable 
of measuring the distance between two points. Ultrasonic technology is one medium to 
show how the distance will be measured and this is widely used today especially in 
general application such as in warfare, engineering and also for scientific and medical 
purposes. This technology is based on ultrasound and a common use of ultrasound is in 
range finding

## Abstract 
This project describes an ultrasonic sensor that is able to measure the distance from the ground of 
selected points of a motor vehicle. The sensor is based on the measurement of the time of flight of an 
ultrasonic pulse, which is reflected by the ground and is composed of only low cost components, thus 
being apt for first car equipment in many cases, and is able to self-adapt to different conditions in 
order to give the best results. 

## Working principle 
Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human 
hearing. The transducer of the sensor acts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. 
Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the 
echo. It works on the same principles as a radar system. An ultrasonic sensor can convert electrical 
energy into acoustic waves and vice versa. The acoustic wave signal is an ultrasonic wave traveling at 
a frequency above 18 kHz.
